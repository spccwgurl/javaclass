<h1>Enlight Photo App</h1>
<p>My favorite photo app is called Enlight.  Itâ€™s a paid app, but worth every penny.  What I especially like doing is taking pictures, adding a black and white filter, and erasing certain elements to make the color pop out.</p>  

<p>Here are some photos I have done.</p>
